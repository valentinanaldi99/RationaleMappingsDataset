# RationaleMappingsDataset

We publish IRT and CRT for three tasks of interest, i.e. Sentiment Analysis (SA), Text Summarization (TS) and Question Answering (QA).
Each file contains a json array of annotated instances. In the case of IRT, each instance is associated with an array "trees" containing all the RT provided for that instance. In the case of CRT, each instance is the CRT for the texts stored in the root.
